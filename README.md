# 💫 Hello, I'm Mohamed:
About me 👋<br><br>As an economics graduate with a diverse background, I've delved into project management for large events, coordinated and taught English programmes in Spain, and conducted legal research. These experiences ignited my interest in technology, where I discovered the potential of digital tools for learning enhancement and gained hands-on experience with data collection systems.<br><br>Currently, I'm enrolled in a 13-week full-stack software engineering bootcamp, diving into various technologies like Java, SQL, Spring, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and Agile methodologies. Alongside technical skills, I'm developing essential professional abilities.<br><br>👨‍💻 I'm currently working on: Mastering software development through my bootcamp journey and applying my interdisciplinary background to innovative tech solutions.<br><br>🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on: Exciting projects at the intersection of technology and education. Let's enhance learning with digital tools!<br><br>🙏 I'm looking for help with: Navigating challenging tech concepts, especially in Spring, React, and Agile. Your expertise is greatly appreciated.<br><br>❓ Ask me about: My journey from economics to tech, teaching English in Spain, or how my project management and legal research background complements my tech pursuits. Feel free to dive into the bootcamp experience too!<br><br>🏊‍♂️🎭🎥 Fun Fact: Beyond coding, you can often find me enjoying sporting activities, especially swimming, or immersing myself in the vibrant worlds of theatre and cinema. If you share these interests or want recommendations for must-see shows and films, let's chat!
